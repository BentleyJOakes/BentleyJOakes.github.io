# LOG6953FE - Digital Twin Engineering

**Digital Twins are an emerging topic in both industry and academia. But what are Digital Twins (DTs), and how can we engineer them?**

A new course ['Digital Twin Engineering'](https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/cours/digital-twin-engineering) will be offered at Polytechnique Montréal in Winter 2025 by Dr. Bentley Oakes (Department of Computer and Software Engineering). The course will be offered in English.

This course is for _graduate students_ or _researchers_ across disciplines who are interested in understanding DTs and their benefits, and who want to obtain hands-on experience. Some background in Python, Docker, Git, and other software engineering tools/concepts will be helpful.

This course will present the _theoretical and practical principles_ for engineering DTs for cyber-physical systems. We will focus on a practical system of an [incubator (a heater in a box)](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/example_digital-twin_incubator). During the course, we'll examine the perspectives, theory, technology, and processes for creating a virtual representation of this system, and using the DT for valuable services such as optimization, visualization, and anomaly detection.

Topics covered: Definitions, examples, benefits, and application areas of digital twins (DTs). DTs, digital shadows, and digital models. DT platforms and DT realization. DT components (services, enablers, models/data). Processes and metrics for DT Engineering. Modelling and  simulation principles. Co-simulation. Communication and sensing. Visualization, monitoring, formal verification, and advanced DT
services. DT reporting.

Parts of this course are based on the textbook [The Engineering of Digital Twins](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-66719-0) by John Fitzgerald, Cláudio Gomes, and Peter Gorm Larsen. Some course slides and material have also been repurposed from the [corresponding course](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/131157/Engineering-Digital-Twins) at Aarhus University, Denmark.

## Course Structure
Each week, we'll have interactive lectures featuring detailed DT examples from across different fields and engaging discussions. You will have six hands-on lab sessions every second week, which are small assignments to become familiar with some DT technologies and services. In team-based projects, you'll apply your learning to develop your own DT or DT service. Options include developing machine-learning based services, investigating formal verification, visualization creation in a game engine such as Unity or Godot, or creating a DT for another system. A small final exam will consolidate your understanding of the theoretical concepts.
