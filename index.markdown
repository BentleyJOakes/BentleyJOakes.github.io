<div style="text-align: center; background: #963232;color:whitesmoke;"><b>I have Master's and PhD positions open, please see my <a href="https://bentleyjoakes.github.io/lab/">lab page</a></b></div>

<img alt="Bentley Oakes" src="/assets/images/BentleyOakes-headshot.jpg" style="float: left;width:180px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" />

<p>I am an <b>Assistant Professor</b> in the <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/gigl/">Department of Computer and Software Engineering (GIGL)</a> at Polytechnique Montréal, Canada.</p>

<p>I am a researcher in the <a href="https://ivado.ca/en/">artificial intelligence consortium IVADO</a>. Polytechnique Montréal is also affiliated with the <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">Université de Montréal</a> and the <a href="https://mila.quebec/en">Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (Mila)</a>.</p>

<p>Our research in the Oakes lab focuses on <b>enabling domain experts to efficiently capture and utilise their knowledge through an intelligent model-driven approach, to support knowledge engineering for complex cyber-physical systems</b>. The goal is to minimise the cognitive and time effort for constructing, verifying, and validating these systems, while still maximising the insights gained during the systems engineering process.</p>

### My main research interests:

### Teaching and service
I teach [LOG6310E - Digital Twin Engineering](https://bentleyjoakes.github.io/dte_course/).

I enjoy my time as reviewer and program committee member for software engineering journals, conferences, and workshops. I am also the lead organizer for the [Software Engineering at Montreal (SEMTL)](https://semtl.github.io/) meetings, which is a regular seminar series for the software engineering researchers in Montreal.

### Academic background
Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the [GEODES lab](http://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca) in the [Department of Computer Science and Operations Research](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/) of the University of Montréal for two years. My research topic was on the modelling of [domain-specific machine learning workflows](https://doi.org/10.1145/3638243).

Before that, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Antwerp in Belgium for three years. I worked on a variety of topics along with industrial partners as part of the [Flanders Make](https://www.flandersmake.be) strategic research centre, including verification of cyber-physical systems, configuring of co-simulations, and developing conceptual frameworks for digital twins.

I received my PhD at McGill University in 2019 on the topic of [model transformation verification](/assets/publications/Oakes2018%20-%20A%20Symbolic%20Execution-Based%20Approach%20To%20Model%20Transformation%20Verification%20using%20Structural%20Contracts.pdf). During this period, I was an instructor for the Introduction to Programming course at McGill for three terms. I also was a visiting researcher at the [General Motors Technical Center](https://www.gm.com/company/facilities/warren-tech-center) in Michigan, USA and the [fortiss research institute](https://www.fortiss.org/) in Munich, Germany.

During my bachelor's degree at the University of Manitoba, I held three internships as part of the co-operative program. The first internship was at [Blackberry](https://www.blackberry.com) (formerly Research in Motion) in Waterloo, ON. The topic of this internship was on cryptographic communication protocols. The second and third internships were at [Electronic Arts](https://www.ea.com) in Montréal, QC. These internships focused on prototyping artifical intelligence solutions in video games.

### Talk Bio

Prof. Bentley Oakes is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer and Software Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal in Canada. He completed his Master's and PhD at McGill University, before becoming a post-doctoral researcher at both the University of Antwerp and the Université de Montréal.

His interests and experiences are diverse, ranging from Digital Twins (including their structure, construction, and reporting) to model-driven engineering, ontologies, verification and validation (including formal verification), machine learning, co-simulation, and many other topics. His research focuses on capturing and utilizing the domain knowledge possessed by domain experts, such that they can more easily construct and reason about their complex systems.

<!-- Prof. Oakes is also very active as a reviewer and organizer in the software engineering and modelling fields. This includes reviewing for TOSEM, SoSyM, and EMSE, and as an organizing committee member for ICSE, FSE, and MODELS.  -->
