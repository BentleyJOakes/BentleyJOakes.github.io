<p>I am an <b>Assistant Professor</b> in the <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/gigl/">Département de génie informatique et génie logiciel (Department of Computer and Software Engineering)</a> at Polytechnique Montréal, Canada. Polytechnique Montréal is affiliated with the <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">Université de Montréal</a> and the <a href="https://mila.quebec/en">Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (Mila)</a></p>

<p>Our research in the Oakes lab focuses on <b>enabling domain experts to efficiently capture and utilise their knowledge through a model-driven approach, to support knowledge engineering for complex cyber-physical systems</b>. The goal is to minimise the cognitive and time effort for constructing, verifying, and validating these systems, while still maximising the insights gained during the systems engineering process.</p>

### My main research interests:
* digital twins, including their structure, [construction](/assets/publications/Oakes2024-Towards_Ontological_Service-Driven_Engineering_of_Digital_Twins.pdf), and [reporting](/assets/publications/Gil2024-Towards_a_Systematic_Reporting_Framework_for_Digital_Twins.pdf)
* representations of domain-specific knowledge, such as [ontologies and ontological reasoning](/assets/publications/Elaasar2023%20-%20openCAESAR%20Balancing%20Agility%20and%20Rigor%20in%20Model-Based%20Systems%20Engineering.pdf)
* verification and validation of cyber-physical systems, including [formal verification](/assets/publications/Bernaerts2019%20-%20Validating%20Industrial%20Requirements%20with%20a%20Contract-Based%20Approach.pdf)
* the application of [machine learning to cyber-physical systems](/assets/publications/Moradi2020%20-%20Exploring%20Fault%20Parameter%20Space%20using%20Reinforcement%20Learning-based%20Fault%20Injection.pdf)
* model-driven engineering techniques
* [model transformations and their verification](/assets/publications/Oakes2018%20-%20A%20Symbolic%20Execution-Based%20Approach%20To%20Model%20Transformation%20Verification%20using%20Structural%20Contracts.pdf)
* and others, as listed on my [expertise page](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/oakes-bentley)

I enjoy my time as reviewer and program committee member for software engineering journals, conferences, and workshops. I am also the lead organizer for the [Software Engineering at Montreal (SEMTL)](https://semtl.github.io/) meetings, which is a regular seminar series for the software engineering researchers in Montreal.

### Academic background:
Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the [GEODES lab](http://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca) in the [Department of Computer Science and Operations Research](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/) of the University of Montréal for two years. My research topic was on the modelling of [domain-specific machine learning workflows](https://doi.org/10.1145/3638243).

Before that, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Antwerp in Belgium for three years. I worked on a variety of topics along with industrial partners as part of the [Flanders Make](https://www.flandersmake.be) strategic research centre, including verification of cyber-physical systems, configuring of co-simulations, and developing conceptual frameworks for digital twins.

I received my PhD at McGill University in 2019 on the topic of [model transformation verification](/assets/publications/Oakes2018%20-%20A%20Symbolic%20Execution-Based%20Approach%20To%20Model%20Transformation%20Verification%20using%20Structural%20Contracts.pdf). During this period, I was an instructor for the Introduction to Programming course at McGill for three terms. I also was a visiting researcher at the [General Motors Technical Center](https://www.gm.com/company/facilities/warren-tech-center) in Michigan, USA and the [fortiss research institute](https://www.fortiss.org/) in Munich, Germany.

During my bachelor's degree at the University of Manitoba, I held three internships as part of the co-operative program. The first internship was at [Blackberry](https://www.blackberry.com) (formerly Research in Motion) in Waterloo, ON. The topic of this internship was on cryptographic communication protocols. The second and third internships were at [Electronic Arts](https://www.ea.com) in Montréal, QC. These internships focused on prototyping artifical intelligence solutions in video games.
