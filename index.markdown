Since September 2021, I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [GEODES lab](http://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca) in the [Department of Computer Science and Operations Research](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/) of the University of Montr√©al. I work with [Houari Sahraoui](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~sahraouh/) and [Michalis Famelis](https://michalis.famelis.info/). Currently, my research topic focuses on understanding and improving how domain experts can build and optimise machine learning solutions.

I received my PhD at McGill University in 2019 on the topic of model transformation verification. During my degree, I was an instructor for the Introduction to Programming course at McGill for three terms. Following my degree, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Antwerp in Belgium for three years. I worked on a variety of topics along with industrial partners, including verification of cyber-physical systems, configuring of co-simulations, and developing conceptual frameworks for digital twins.
