I am an **Assistant Professor** in the [Département de génie informatique et génie logiciel (Department of Computer and Software Engineering)](https://www.polymtl.ca/gigl/) at Polytechnique Montréal, Canada.

My research focuses on **enabling domain experts to efficiently capture and utilise their knowledge to build software systems (including digital twins) through a model-driven approach**. The goal is to minimise the cognitive and time effort for constructing these systems, while still maximising the insights gained during the engineering process.


My main research interests include:
* digital twins, including their structure and construction
* representation of domain-specific knowledge, such as employing ontologies and ontological reasoning
* verification of cyber-physical systems
* model-driven engineering techniques, and the intersection with low-code platforms
* model transformations and their verification
* and others, as listed on my [expertise page](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/oakes-bentley)

I enjoy my time as reviewer and program committee member for software engineering journals, conferences, and workshops. I am also the lead organizer for the [Software Engineering at Montreal](https://semtl.github.io/) (SEMTL) meetings, which is a regular seminar series for the software engineering researchers in Montreal.

Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the [GEODES lab](http://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca) in the [Department of Computer Science and Operations Research](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/) of the University of Montréal for two years. My research topic was on the modelling of domain-specific machine learning workflows.

Before that, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Antwerp in Belgium for three years. I worked on a variety of topics along with industrial partners as part of the [Flanders Make](https://www.flandersmake.be) strategic research centre, including verification of cyber-physical systems, configuring of co-simulations, and developing conceptual frameworks for digital twins.

I received my PhD at McGill University in 2019 on the topic of model transformation verification. During my degree, I was an instructor for the Introduction to Programming course at McGill for three terms. I also was a visiting researcher at the [General Motors Technical Center](https://www.gm.com/company/facilities/warren-tech-center) in Michigan, USA and the [fortiss research institute](https://www.fortiss.org/) in Munich, Germany.

During my bachelor's degree at the University of Manitoba, I held three internships as part of the co-operative program. The first internship was at [Blackberry](https://www.blackberry.com) (formerly Research in Motion) in Waterloo, ON. The topic of this internship was on cryptographic communication protocols. The second and third internships were at [Electronic Arts](https://www.ea.com) in Montréal, QC. These internships focused on prototyping artifical intelligence solutions.
