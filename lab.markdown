## About My Lab

My lab focuses on the *digital engineering of complex cyber-physical systems*. This involves starting with the expert's domain knowledge, capturing it in models, and then using this knowledge to better construct, optimize, verify, and validate systems.

Please see the main page for a list of my varied research topics, which include digital twins, ontologies, workflows, and machine learning.
