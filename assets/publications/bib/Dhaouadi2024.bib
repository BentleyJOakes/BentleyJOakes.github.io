  abstract  = {Code commit messages can contain useful information on why a developer has made a change. However, the presence and structure of rationale in real-world code commit messages is not well studied. Here, we detail the creation of a labelled dataset to analyze the code commit messages of the Linux Kernel Out-Of-Memory Killer component. We study aspects of rationale information, such as presence, temporal evolution, and structure. We find that 98.9\% of commits in our dataset contain sentences with rationale information, and that experienced developers report rationale in about 60\% of the sentences in their commits. We report on the challenges we faced and provide examples for our labelling.},
