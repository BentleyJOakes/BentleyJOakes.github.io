  abstract = {Humans often switch between multiple levels of abstraction when reasoning about salient properties of complex systems. These changes in perspective may be leveraged at runtime to improve both performance and explainability, while still producing identical answers to questions about the properties of interest. This technique, which switches between multiple abstractions based on changing conditions in the modelled system, is also known as adaptive abstraction.The Modelica language represents systems as a-causal continuous equations, which makes it appropriate for the modelling of physical systems. However adaptive abstraction requires dynamic structure modelling. This raises many technical challenges in Modelica since it has poor support for modifying connections during simulation. Its equation-based nature means that all equations need to be well-formed at all times, which may not hold when switching between levels of abstraction. The initialization of models upon switching must also be carefully managed, as information will be lost or must be created when switching abstractions [1].One way to allow adaptive abstraction is to represent the system as a multi-mode hybrid Modelica model, a mode being an abstraction that can be switched to based on relevant criteria. Another way is to employ a co-simulation [2] approach, where modes are exported as "black boxes" and orchestrated by a central algorithm that implements adaptivity techniques to dynamically replace components when a switching condition occurs.This talk will discuss the benefits of adaptive abstraction using Modelica, and the conceptual and technical challenges towards its implementation. As a stand-in for a complex cyber-physical system, an electrical transmission line case study is proposed where attenuation is studied across two abstractions having varying fidelity depending on the signal. Our initial results, as well as our explorations towards employing Modelica models in a co-simulation context using the DEVS formalism [4] are discussed. A Modelica only solution allows to tackle complexity via decomposition, but does not improve performances as all modes are represented as a single set of equations. The co-simulation approach might offer better performances [3], but complicates the workflow.},

This article presents to software engineering researchers the six key challenges that a domain expert faces in addressing their problem with a computational workflow, and the underlying executable implementation. These challenges arise out of our conceptual framework which presents the “route” of transformations that a domain expert may choose to take while developing their solution.To ground our conceptual framework in the state of the practice, this article discusses a selection of available textual and graphical workflow systems and their support for the transformations described in our framework. Example studies from the literature in various domains are also examined to highlight the tools used by the domain experts as well as a classification of the domain specificity and machine learning usage of their problem, workflow, and implementation.The state of the practice informs our discussion of the six key challenges, where we identify which challenges and transformations are not sufficiently addressed by available tools. We also suggest possible research directions for software engineering researchers to increase the automation of these tools and disseminate best-practice techniques between software engineering and various scientific domains.},

A proven technique to handle the complexity of CPSs is Model-Based Design (MBD). Nevertheless, the verification and validation of complex CPSs is still an exhaustive process and the usability of the models to front-load V\&V activities heavily depends on the knowledge of the models and the correctness of the conducted virtual experiments. In this paper, we explore how the effort (and cost) of the V\&V phase of the engineering process of complex CPSs can be reduced by enhancing the knowledge about the system components, and explicitly capturing it within their corresponding validity frame. This effort reduction originates from exploiting the captured system knowledge to generate efficient V\&V processes and by automating activities at different model life stages, such as the setup and execution of boundary-value or fault-injection tests. This will be discussed in the context of a complex CPS: a safety-critical adaptive cruise control system.},

However, writing a correct transformation requires the user to understand both what the transformation should do and how to enact that change in the transformation. This easily leads to syntactic and semantic errors in transformations which are time-consuming to locate and fix. In this article, we extend our evolutionary algorithm (EA) approach to automatically repair transformations containing multiple semantic errors. To prevent the fitness plateaus and the single fitness peak limitations from our previous work, we include the notion of social diversity as an objective for our EA to promote repair patches tackling errors that are less covered by the other patches of the population. We evaluate our approach on four ATL transformations, which have been mutated to contain up to five semantic errors simultaneously. Our evaluation shows that integrating social diversity when searching for repair patches improves the quality of those patches and speeds up the convergence even when up to five semantic errors are involved.},

  abstract = {The verification of model transformations is important for realizing robust model-driven engineering technologies and quality-assured automation. Many approaches for checking properties of model transformations have been proposed. Most of them have focused on the effective and efficient detection of property violations by contract checking. However, there remains the fault localization step between identifying a failing contract for a transformation based on verification feedback and precisely identifying the faulty rules. While there exist fault localization approaches in the model transformation verification literature, these require the creation and maintenance of test cases, which imposes an additional burden on the developer. In this paper, we combine transformation verification based on symbolic execution with spectrum-based fault localization techniques for identifying the faulty rules in DSLTrans model transformations. This fault localization approach operates on the path condition output of symbolic transformation checkers instead of requiring a set of test input models. In particular, we introduce a workflow for running the symbolic execution of a model transformation, evaluating the defined contracts for satisfaction, and computing different measures for tracking the faulty rules. We evaluate the effectiveness of spectrum-based analysis techniques for tracking faulty rules and compare our approach to previous works. We evaluate our technique by introducing known mutations into five model transformations. Our results show that the best spectrum-based analysis techniques allow for effective fault localization, showing an average EXAM score below 0.30 (less than 30{\%} of the transformation needs to be inspected). These techniques are also able to locate the faulty rule in the top-three ranked rules in 70{\%} of all cases. The impact of the model transformation, the type of mutation and the type of contract on the results is discussed. Finally, we also investigate the cases where the technique does not work properly, including discussion of a potential pre-check to estimate the prospects of the technique for a certain transformation.},

  abstract  = {Code commit messages can contain useful information on why a developer has made a change. However, the presence and structure of rationale in real-world code commit messages is not well studied. Here, we detail the creation of a labelled dataset to analyze the code commit messages of the Linux Kernel Out-Of-Memory Killer component. We study aspects of rationale information, such as presence, temporal evolution, and structure. We find that 98.9\% of commits in our dataset contain sentences with rationale information, and that experienced developers report rationale in about 60\% of the sentences in their commits. We report on the challenges we faced and provide examples for our labelling.},
