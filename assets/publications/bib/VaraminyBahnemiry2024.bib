  abstract = {Model transformations play an essential role in the model-driven engineering paradigm. However, writing a correct transformation requires the user to understand both what the transformation should do and how to enact that change in the transformation. This easily leads to syntactic and semantic errors in transformations which are time-consuming to locate and fix. In this article, we extend our evolutionary algorithm (EA) approach to automatically repair transformations containing multiple semantic errors. To prevent the fitness plateaus and the single fitness peak limitations from our previous work, we include the notion of social diversity as an objective for our EA to promote repair patches tackling errors that are less covered by the other patches of the population. We evaluate our approach on four ATL transformations, which have been mutated to contain up to five semantic errors simultaneously. Our evaluation shows that integrating social diversity when searching for repair patches improves the quality of those patches and speeds up the convergence even when up to five semantic errors are involved.},
